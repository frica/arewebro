# "Are we bro?" application

![unit tests](https://github.com/github/docs/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

Close to be the stupidest application on Earth, but it was funny to reach a goal set by my friends :grin:

This serves also as a playground to learn about UI development in Python and GitHub internals.

Built with [NiceGUI](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/)

TODO:

- [x] unit tests

- [ ] release tag

- [ ] installer

- [x] Github action

- [ ] better string compare

- [ ] configurable name list
